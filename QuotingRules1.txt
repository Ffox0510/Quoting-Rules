## This is the difference between single quoted
## and double quoted strings, double quoted strings will
## interpret the value in the variable if preceded
## by a $, and display that, single quoted string will
## display the string literally.  

## To prevent the substitution of a variable value in 
## in a double-quoted string, use the backtick character 
(`) which is the Powershell escape character.  

## $i = 5
## "The value of `$i is $i."
